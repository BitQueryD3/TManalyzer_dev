Description: Combines 3 common text mining models BVSM, GVSM(TT) and LSA for information retrieval analysis.
    After extracting the weighted data fields from a structured list (parsed from YAML or DCF text documents), the text corpus
    is transformed into 3 models. The search queries can be embedded into the appropriate models, the desired similarity method
    from the "proxy" package can be applied and an comprehensive IR analysis can be performed.
